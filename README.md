# flight-metasearcher
Full-stack flight meta searcher developed with 2 of my peers in The Bridge. This project compares airlines scrapped using Puppeteer and Cheerio. Then we also compare the flights to see which one is cheaper in our backend using Node.js and Express.js. Our frontend (HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript) receives only one flight to return to the user linked to the original page.
